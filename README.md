# ðŸ’ªDifferent Types of Recommendation Systems :
It is likely that you will concur that there are multiple approaches to determining what to suggest or recommend when a friend seeks our opinion. This principle is equally applicable to artificial intelligence.

thier are three techniques for constructing recommendation engines are
1. Simple Recommendation.
2. Content-based filtering.
3. Collaborative filtering.

## 1- Simple Recommendation
Recommend an item based on its own popularity,
Build Simple Recommender System based on the metric below:
```
weightedRating(WR) = ((v/v+m).R) + ((m/v+m).C)
```
## 2- content-based filtering:
This method generates suggestions *based on items* you have previously liked. It uses historical data such as purchase records and search history to identify similar products. 

> For example, if you rated the movie "Inception" with five stars, the system will recommend similar movies such as "Interstellar".

However, if all recommendation systems solely relied on your viewing history, discovering new genres and films would be challenging. This is where **Collaborative filtering** comes into play. But what exactly does it entail?.


## 2- Collaborative filtering:
This method identifies other users who have similar preferences to you, and recommends items **based on their choices**. 

> For example, if you and your friend both like the movie "The Shawshank Redemption", and your friend also likes "Forrest Gump", the system will recommend "Forrest Gump" to you.
